[Verse]
A stone so cold it burned my hand
It whispered secrets I couldn't understand
It pulsed like a heartbeat but it wasn’t mine
Felt the pull of stars in a crooked line

[Chorus]
Through the dark and deep I fall
No up no down just the endless sprawl
Alien whispers call my name
This stone's a portal
Nothing’s the same

[Verse]
I saw a sun with no shadow to cast
Planets colliding in a cosmic blast
Galaxies dancing like they knew my face
Time was a thread unraveling in space

[Prechorus]
I touched the edge of a dying star
The stone hummed louder
I’d gone too far

[Chorus]
Through the dark and deep I fall
No up no down just the endless sprawl
Alien whispers call my name
This stone's a portal
Nothing’s the same

[Bridge]
I felt the earth but it wasn’t the same
Mountains were glass
Rivers were flame
The stone still glows
It won’t let me be
Its voice is louder
It’s becoming me
