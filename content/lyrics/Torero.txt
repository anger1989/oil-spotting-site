[Verse]
Neon dust across the sky,
I ride the orbit, fire in my eyes.
Stars are roaring, the void’s alive —
I chase the comet, to feel I’m divine.

[Pre-Chorus]
Silver blood in my veins,
Echoes call my name.
Every heartbeat’s a flame —
I was born for this game.

[Chorus]
Hey! I’m the Torero of the night,
Dancing through the cosmic light!
With a comet in my hand, I’ll make it mine,
Hey! I’m the shadow and the shine!
No gravity can break my line —
I fight the stars, but they burn divine!

[Verse]
Solar winds cut through my soul,
Dreams of fire take control.
Through the silence, I hear the crowd —
Voices of the past, screaming loud!

[Pre-Chorus]
Silver blood in my veins,
Echoes call my name.
Every heartbeat’s a flame —
I was born for this game.

[Bridge]
Ole! The universe’s arena,
My cape’s the Milky Way!
Ole! I dance with fate and plasma,
Before it fades away!
One last orbit, one last cry —
Catch the comet or I die!

[Final Chorus]
Hey! I’m the Torero of the night,
Dancing through the cosmic light!
With a comet in my hand, I’ll make it mine,
Hey! I’m the shadow and the shine!
No gravity can chain my pride —
I fight the stars till the end of time!

[Outro]
…Catch the comet, catch the flame…
Cosmic Torero — remember my name.
