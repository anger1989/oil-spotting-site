[Verse]
He was born a pure white dove
With eyes of wonder
Bright and big as the sun
But when he hit the ground
He lost himself to temptation
And slowly
Slowly
Turned blacker and blacker

[Chorus]
Now he's a black hole
Now he's a black hole

[Verse]
His mind was crystal clear
He'd light up any room
That he'd appear
He flew so close to the sun
Lost his wings
And tumbled down
Down
Down

[Chorus]
Now he's a black hole
Now he's a black hole
Now he's a black hole
Now he's a black hole
