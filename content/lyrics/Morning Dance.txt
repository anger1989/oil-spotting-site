[Verse]
Sunlight's peeking
Ooh
It’s new (ooh-yeah!)
Coffee's steaming
Feel the view
Stretch it out
The day begins
Let the rhythm pull you in
Pull you in

[Chorus]
Morning dance
Morning dance (oh-oh!)
Move your feet
Take the chance
Spin around
Take a stance (hey-hey!)
Morning dance
Morning dance

[Verse]
Windows open
Fresh and free
Hear the birds
They're calling me (tweet-tweet!)
Step by step
The floor’s alive
Feel the beat
It’s Nine to Five
Nine to Five

[Prechorus]
No rush
No race (uh-huh!)
Just the groove
Just the space

[Chorus]
Morning dance
Morning dance (oh-oh!)
Move your feet
Take the chance
Spin around
Take a stance (hey-hey!)
Morning dance
Morning dance

[Bridge]
Twist and turn
The clock can wait
Let your body celebrate (whoo!)
Jump and sway
Feel the light
Dance until the morning's bright
Oh bright
