[Verse]
I blinked and the stars rewound
Through the void I wasn’t bound
A leap
A crack
A cosmic sound

Landed soft on an unknown stone
Breathing air that wasn’t my own
A place where time had overthrown

[Chorus]
And there she stood
A mirror bent
Her face
My face
Yet different
I fell in love with a twisted truth
A version of me
But laced with youth

[Verse 2]
Her voice was mine
Yet sweeter still
A melody that bent my will
The universe played its cruel thrill

Her hands knew all the scars I hide
She spoke my fears I couldn’t confide
We laughed
And I forgot the divide

[Prechorus]
Am I dreaming
Am I whole
Or just chasing shadows of my soul
