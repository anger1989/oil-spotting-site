Pau whau...

[Verse]
Stars are screaming through the black void haze
Man in a space plane lost in his craze
A bottle of fire
His co-pilot tonight
He’s got no map
Just a galactic fight

[Chorus]
Cosmic soldiers in the war of the skies
Burning like comets
Never asking why
Drunk on danger
Drunk on the stars (Bottle in fly)
Fighting for nothing in a galaxy of  ice... uhmm... 
Galaxy of ice.

[Verse]
The enemy ships like shadows they swarm
Lasers like lightning in a cosmic storm
He laughs too loud
Tips the bottle back
Dodging death on a drunken track

[Prechorus]
No up
No down
Just endless space
He’s chasing chaos
He’s lost the race

[Chorus]
Cosmic soldiers in the war of the skies
Burning like comets
Never asking why
Drunk on danger
Drunk on the stars (Bottle in fly)
Fighting for nothing in a galaxy of ice...

Tsss....Galaxy of ice.

[Bridge]
Through asteroid fields
Through shattered dreams
He hears the echoes of his own screams
A hero or fool
Who can really say
When you're lost in the galaxy
Drifting away
