[Verse]
Red dust rises as I walk alone
A million miles from what I called home
Sky burns like fire but it chills my bones

[Chorus]
Sunshine on Mars feels colder than rain
I'm a man from another planet drowning in pain
I left the Earth but the Earth won't leave my brain

[Verse]
Rocks don’t talk but they sure do stare
A quiet witness to my blank despair
The silence here
It’s too much to bear

[Prechorus]
I built a life in the sky
But I still ask myself why

[Chorus]
Sunshine on Mars feels colder than rain
I'm a man from another planet drowning in pain
I left the Earth but the Earth won't leave my brain

[Bridge]
I dream of rivers that run so deep
The hum of the city
The nights without sleep
Here there’s no chaos
No love to keep
