[Verse]
Flash bends the sky
Stars wink goodbye
Engines hum a tune
Dive — neon lagoon

[Chorus]
Hyperjump — let’s go!
Clouds stretch, colors glow
Rules twist, can’t relate
Toons rule — animate!

[Verse]
Planets bounce high
Time drips by
Ships grin wide
Gravity lied

[Pre-Chorus]
Up? Down? Who knows?
Reality froze

[Chorus]
Hyperjump — let’s go!
Clouds stretch, colors glow
Rules twist, can’t relate
Toons rule — animate!

[Bridge]
Sun’s got shades
Moons parade
Colors sing loud
Physics bowed
