[Verse]
A suit of silver
A heart of lead
No stars above
Just void instead
He drifts
He drifts
Through endless night
No planets in sight
No guiding light

[Prechorus]
The silence screams
It pulls
It bends
Infinity's arms
Where time suspends

[Chorus]
Alone spaceman
Where do you go
Through the dark to the black hole
Alone spaceman
What do you see
Nothing but shadows swallowing me

[Verse 2]
No echoes left
No trail to trace
He whispers dreams to the empty space
A flicker of hope
Then it fades to gray
The black hole calls
And he drifts away

[Bridge]
Spinning
Spinning
Caught in its throat
A spiral dance
No rescue boat
He laughs
He cries
It’s all the same
In the end
Just a forgotten name

[Chorus]
Alone spaceman
Where do you go
Through the dark to the black hole
Alone spaceman
What do you see
Nothing but shadows swallowing me
