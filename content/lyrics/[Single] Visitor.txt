[Verse]
I'm not like you
Man
Born to change the world
The alien from a different star

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a bird in the cage
In your government I stay
In the basement under surveillance
They won't let me leave
I fell in love with a girl
From a planet full of war
Born to change the world
The alien from a different star

[Chorus]
Like a bird in the cage
In your government I stay
In the basement under surveillance
They won't let me leave
I fell in love with a girl
From a planet full of war
Born to change the world
The alien from a different star
